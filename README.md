This add-on can be installed in Chrome and Firefox.

When you navigate to the Spoondollars page of your Spoonflower account, it will display an extra table at the
end of the page which contains aggregrate statistics about your fabric sales.

Note: I am not officially associated with Spoonflower in any way (other than being a customer). This app is not
officially supported and may break at any time due to changes on the Spoonflower side.

Installation instructions:

Download the zip file and expand it somewhere.

For Chrome:

1. Open up Chrome and type chrome://extensions/ in the nav bar
2. Check the box that says "Developer mode"
3. Click the "load unpacked extension" button
4. Navigate to the directory that contains the files from the zip file and click "select"

For Firefox:

1. Open up the directory that contains the files from the zip file and find the file spoondollar_bookkeeper.xpi.
2. Open up Firefox and drag-and-drop spoondollar_bookkeeper.xpi into the Firefox window.
3. Click "install now" on the dialog that pops up.

Now, when you go to the "spoondollars" page of your Spoonflower account and scroll all the way to the bottom,
you will see the new table. If you click on the "Total Revenue", "Total Sales", or "Total Square Feet" headers,
the data will sort based on those numbers.
